This paper introduces Lite-Diffusion (L-Diff), a compressed diffusion model designed for efficient and rapid inference on edge devices. By leveraging a combination of modern model compression techniques—including pruning variants, quantization, knowledge distillation, and the novel application of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)—we reduce model size and computational requirements without substantial loss in image quality. A real-world example illustrates the utility of deploying DDPMs on edge devices: enabling offline content generation for augmented reality applications on smartphones, where quick and efficient image synthesis is crucial. We evaluate various combinations of these techniques to develop the best-performing compressed model.",link:"https://github.com/DarshGondalia/Prune-QuantizationDDPM"},{title:"Defense Against One-Pixel Attacks",description:'Ensuring robust visual classification is crucial in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving, where even a single misclassification—of a pedestrian, traffic light, or road sign—could have catastrophic consequences. Recent work has demonstrated that state-of-the-art classifiers can be easily fooled by minor adversarial perturbations, such as altering a single pixel in a CIFAR-10 image (the ``one-pixel attack") {Su2019}. In this paper, we examine a range of defense strategies designed to mitigate this vulnerability by cleansing attacked images before they are classified. We also introduce novel defense pipelines tailored specifically for combating the one-pixel attack, and more generally an n-pixel attack. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, we evaluate the effectiveness of these defenses in fortifying models like LeNet and ResNet. Our findings show that combining existing defense strategies can create robust classification systems, offering promising solutions for applications requiring near-faultless performance.',link:"https://github.com/DarshGondalia/DefenseAgainstOnePixelAttacks"},{title:"Movie Recommendation System",description:"Integrated Popularity Based System, Content-Based Filtering, Collaborative Filtering & Hybrid System to recommend movies to users based on preferences & likings.
